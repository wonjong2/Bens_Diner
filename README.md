## Assignment Description

This is a Javascript homework assignment for the UW Bootcamp. The goal of the assignment is to create the backend functionality for an online "warehouse". The Javascript file is the primary challenge of this assignment with user information persisting, stored, and accessed using mySQL databases. "Inquirer", "express", "mySQL2", and "sequelize" NPM packages shall be used. The entirety of the application will be run from the console.

A mockup is provided by the instructor to demonstrate desired application appearance and functionality.

The original user story, acceptance criteria, and mockup for the assignment is copied to the end of this document.

## Assignment Scope
